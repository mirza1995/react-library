# Button

Buttons are used to trigger an action.

This typically happens on the current page.
For complex actions, navigation to a new and directly connected page might as part of the action.

- Primary button: High emphasis for key actions in a flow.
- Secondary button: For series of actions without hierarchy.
- Tertiary button: A subtle action that stands on its own.
- Text button: A subtle action that stands on its own.

Tertiary and text buttons should always be used with an icon to distinguish them clearly from links.
Pure navigation should be handled using links.
